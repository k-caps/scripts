The keybindings I need to be universal on Mac +  Linux are:  
```
cmd + c
cmd + v
cmd + q
cmd + l
cmd + tab
cmd + space
ctrl + space 
```	
I achieved this with the following combination of settings:

### Gnome tweaks > Keyboard & Mouse > Additional layout options:  
  **Ctrl position:**  
    `Left Ctrl as Meta`  
  **Alt / Win key behavior:**  
    `Ctrl is mapped to Win and the usual Ctrl keys`
		
### System Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts:  
```
Search: Ctrl + Space
Switch applications: Ctrl + Tab
Lock Screen: Ctrl + L
Close Window: Ctrl + Q
Switch to next input source: Alt + Super + Space (in reality click left ctrl, it inputs as Alt + Super)
```

I might soon realize I've broken things that I haven't though of yet, but for now, my most used shortcuts are in the same place on my keyboard.
