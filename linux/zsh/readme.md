To automaticall install zsh, oh-my-zsh, and activate git, syntax highlithting, and autocompletion plugins, run the following line:
```
sh -c "$(wget https://gitlab.com/k-caps/scripts/-/raw/master/linux/zsh/config_zsh.sh -O -)"
```
During the script's run, you will be asked if you want to set zsh as your default shell. Press <kbd>enter</kbd>, and you will be dropped into a zsh prompt. Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> to get back into the previous shell to continue the script's run, which will end with an interactive dialog helping you configure your p10k prompts.
